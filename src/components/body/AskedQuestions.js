                    Bitcoin is a form of digital currency which is based on a
                    created open source code held electronically. <br />
                    Bitcoin is a decentralized form of currency meaning that it
                    does not belong to any government and it is not controlled
                    by one.

                    You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any
                    emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of
                    anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic
                    economic rules.

                    When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing
                    money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins still remain in the
                    block chain just like any other bitcoins. However, lost
                    bitcoins remain dormant forever because there is no way for
                    anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to
                    be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand,
                    when fewer bitcoins are available, the ones that are left
                    will be in higher demand and increase in value to
                    compensate.

                    New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and
                    decentralized process called "mining". This process involves
                    that individuals are rewarded by the network for their
                    services. Bitcoin miners are processing transactions and
                    securing the network using specialized hardware and are
                    collecting new bitcoins in exchange.

                    Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of
                    money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability,
                    portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and
                    recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics
                    rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and
                    silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat
                    currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics.{' '}

                    The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand.
                    When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and
                    when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited
                    number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are
                    created at a predictable and decreasing rate.

                    While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to
                    sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal
                    payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these
                    payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys
                    bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the
                    transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback.
